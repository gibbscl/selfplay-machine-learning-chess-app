# selfplay-machine-learning-chess-machine
Utilizing the framework from AlphaZero research papers, this is an implementation of a self-play machine learning chess machine using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with skip connections
(Residual Network) and Monte Carlo tree search to self-play and learn. Project contains a GUI for human vs. human play, human vs network play, and visualization of self-play while the network is
learning.
